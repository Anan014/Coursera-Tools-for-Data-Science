# Open Source Tools for Data Science

This repository contains materials and exercises from the [Open Source Tools for Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/open-source-tools-for-data-science?specialization=ibm-data-science) course offered by IBM on Coursera. The course is part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and provides an overview of essential tools used in data science.

## Course Overview

The course introduces various open-source tools commonly used by data scientists, including:

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
- **RStudio**: An integrated development environment (IDE) for R, a programming language for statistical computing and graphics.
- **Git and GitHub**: Version control systems that help manage changes to source code over time.
- **Watson Studio**: A cloud-based platform for data science, offering a suite of tools for data analysis and machine learning.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, learners will be able to:

- Describe the data scientistâ€™s toolkit, including libraries, packages, datasets, machine learning models, and big data tools.
- Utilize programming languages commonly used by data scientists, such as Python, R, and SQL.
- Demonstrate proficiency in tools like Jupyter Notebooks and RStudio, leveraging their features for data analysis.
- Create and manage source code for data science projects using Git repositories and GitHub.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes:

- **Lecture Notes**: Summaries and key points from each module.
- **Hands-on Labs**: Practical exercises to apply the concepts learned, including working with Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio, and GitHub.
